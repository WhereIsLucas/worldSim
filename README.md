# World Sim

## Todo

- [x] Make predators faster than preys
- [x]  Allow preys to run away from predators (Iris)
- [ ]  Adjust a sensing range for predators (conical form rather than a circle to represent the reality better) (Lucas)
- [x]  Plot the evolution of predators and preys population
- [x] JSON file for parameters (Lucas)
- [ ]  Potentially find a better random because two creatures overlap when put on the sides far too often (and if it is
  a predator and a prey, the latter is directly eaten)
- [ ]  Perhaps make the world a bit smaller (or increase steps per day) ? Because the creatures do not even have time to
  cover half of the plane in a day
- [ ]  Think about and opt for the best eating range
- [ ]  Decide when predators can replicate (after one or two preys)
- [ ]  Review the number of steps because they don't lose enough energy and come back the next day even though they
  haven't eaten (see with speed as well)


## A few ideas :

* terrain differences
    * Water sources in some areas
* night/day
* predator/prey behaviour
* Multiple layers of food chain (herbivore/carnivore)
* Personality traits (reckless vs cautious)
* 

## and now

* speed
* predator/prey behaviour
* terrains effect
