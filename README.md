# World Sim

## Todo
* add a form of sensing with range
* creatures have a target (food) or wander randomly
* add energy to every creature, and they consume energy while moving
* creatures should return to home (border of the map) before the end of the day

## Coding alternatives
* Allow change in direction every few steps to cover more ground (see Levy flight --> good for continuous method)
* Change rand() by specific distribution drawing if needed

## A few ideas :
* terrain differences
* night/day
* predator/prey behaviour
* Multiple layers of food chain (herbivore/carnivore)
* Personality traits (reckless vs cautious)
