# World Sim

## Todo
* add a form of sensing with range
  * creatures have a target (food) or wander randomly
* add energy to every creature, and they consume energy while moving
* creatures should return to home (border of the map) before the end of the day
  * 

## A few ideas :
* terrain differences
* night/day
* predator/prey behaviour
* Multiple layers of a food chain
